\subsection{\acs{ISO}/\acs{IEC} 27001}
This standard provides a model for establishing, implementing, operating, reviewing, maintaining and improving an \ac{ISMS}. The standard adopts the ``Plan-Do-Check-Act" model to structure all \ac{ISMS} processes. The \ac{ISMS} takes information security requirements and expectations of interested parties as input and produces information security outcomes that meet those requirements. The standard encourages to emphasize the importance of:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep-0.2cm
\item understanding an organization's information security requirements and the need to establish policy and objectives for information security;
\item implementing and operating controls to manage an organization's information security risks in the context of the organization's overall business risks;
\item monitoring and reviewing the performing and effectiveness of the \ac{ISMS}; and
\item continual improvement based on objective measurement.
\end{itemize}
