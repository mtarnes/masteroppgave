\label{chp:CaseIntroductions}
This chapter gives an introduction to the specific cases studied in this thesis. The study contains three separate cases where a different organization is studied in each case. All of the organizations are classified as large organizations. In Norway an organization is large if it has more than 100 employees \cite{SMB}.

\section{Case A}

\section{Case B}

\section{Case C}
This organization is a large Norwegian organization with several thousand employees. They deliver IT-services to customers in addition to operating their own infrastructure. The interviewee is the IT security manager  and the operational leader of a department that is responsible for security, quality, compliance and risk. He has had this role for about two years.

In such a large organization, departments have different requirements for security and thus various policies are implemented throughout the organization. In addition to operating their own incident management, they are also responsible incidents concerning services they deliver to customers. Consequently, the organization deals with security incidents on a daily basis. In addition to dedicated incident managers, the organization has its own \ac{IRT} to assist in major incidents. The \ac{IRT} also handles incoming notifications from internal users regarding security issues and may also deal with incidents concerning customers.
