\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sec:Definitions}
%Eller et annet navn, poenget er å includere definisjoner av disse tidlig i rapporten
In information security incident management there are a few terms that need to be defined clearly. Two such terms are information or computer security incidents\footnote{In this report the terms ``information security incident", ``computer security incident" and ``incident" are used interchangeably.} %NB! På slutten, sjekk at dette faktisk stemmer!
and information or computer security events. It is important to recognize these as two terms of different meaning. The standard \acs{ISO}/\acs{IEC} 27000 \cite{ISO/IEC27000} specifies the following definitions:

\textbf{Information security event:} Identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of information security policy or failure of safeguards, or a previously unknown situation that may be security relevant.

\textbf{Information security incident:} Single or a series of unwanted or unexpected \emph{information security events} that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.

The guidelines \acs{NIST} SP 800-61 \cite{nist800-61} specifies the following definitions:

\textbf{Event:} An event is an observable occurrence in a system or network.

\textbf{Adverse event:} Adverse events are events with a negative consequence, such as system crashes, packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and execution of malware that destroys data.

\textbf{Computer security incident:} A violation or imminent threat of violation\footnote{An ``imminent threat of violation" refers to a situation in which the organization has a factual basis for believing that a specific incident is about to occur.} of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.

The definition of an adverse event from \cite{nist800-61} is quite similar to the definition of information security event from \cite{ISO/IEC27000}. The definitions of incidents are also quite similar. These definitions are the ones that will be used in this report.
