\section{Incident Management Overview}
%Eller noe i den duren, måtte bare ha en section til subsectionen :p
\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sec:Definitions}
%Eller et annet navn, poenget er å includere definisjoner av disse tidlig i rapporten
In information security incident management there are a few terms that need to be defined clearly. Two such terms are information or computer security incidents\footnote{In this report the terms ``information security incident", ``computer security incident" and ``incident" are used interchangeably.} %NB! På slutten, sjekk at dette faktisk stemmer!
and information or computer security events. It is important to recognize these as two terms of different meaning. The standard \acs{ISO}/\acs{IEC} 27000 \cite{ISO/IEC27000} and \acs{ISO}/\acs{IEC} 27035\cite{ISO/IEC27035} specifies the following definitions:

\textbf{Information security event:} Identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of information security policy or failure of safeguards, or a previously unknown situation that may be security relevant.

\textbf{Information security incident:} Single or a series of unwanted or unexpected \emph{information security events} that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.

\textbf{\ac{ISIRT}:} Team of appropriately skilled and trusted members of the organization that handles information security incidents during their lifecycle.

The guidelines \acs{NIST} SP 800-61 \cite{nist800-61} specifies the following definitions:

\textbf{Event:} An event is an observable occurrence in a system or network.

\textbf{Adverse event:} Adverse events are events with a negative consequence, such as system crashes, packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and execution of malware that destroys data.

\textbf{Computer security incident:} A violation or imminent threat of violation\footnote{An ``imminent threat of violation" refers to a situation in which the organization has a factual basis for believing that a specific incident is about to occur.} of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.

\acs{NorCERT} specifies the following definitions \cite{NorCERT3Kvartal2012}:

\textbf{\ac{CSIRT}:} A central tool with the task of protecting important infrastructure. The team must consist of security specialists and they must handle and responds to incidents. Additionally they need to create awareness and educators.

\textbf{\ac{CERT}:} A trademark that can only be used after approval by Carnegie Mellon University. Is in practice the same as a \acs{CSIRT}.

The definition of an adverse event from \cite{nist800-61} is quite similar to the definition of information security event from \cite{ISO/IEC27000}. The definitions of incidents are also quite similar. These definitions are the ones that will be used in this report. \ac{ISIRT}, \ac{CSIRT} and \ac{CERT} define similar types of teams. In this report the term \acs{IRT} is used to denote such a team. 

\subsection{What is Incident Management}
It is important to note that incident response requires a substantial amount of planning and resources. Some of the most important parts of incident response are the existence of guidelines related to communication and related to prioritizing incidents and the use of a lessons learned process to gain value from incidents. \cite{nist800-61}

An organization should have an incident response policy, an incident response plan and incident response procedures, all of which should be tailored to the specific organization's needs. The policy usually includes elements such as prioritization or severity ratings of incidents, a definition of computer security incidents and reporting and contact forms. The plan usually includes an organizational approach to incident response, how the incident response team will communicate with the rest of the organization and with other organizations and metrics for measuring the incident response capability. Procedures should be based on the incident response policy and plan. \acp{SOP} are a delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists and forms used by the incident response team. An organization should establish procedures regarding communication with various outside parties, like media, law enforcement, other incident response teams, software vendors and \acp{ISP}. It is common to have \acp{PoC} for the various outside parties. \cite{nist800-61}

Additionally it is important to have a planned approach to reporting of vulnerabilities that have not yet been exploited \cite{ISO/IEC27035}.

\subsection{\acl{IRT}}
Organizations should have an incident response team available to handle incidents. The number of people responding depends on the magnitude of the incident. Large organizations can choose to have several incident response teams, e.g. one team per division. The teams can consist of employees or be partially or fully outsourced. The team members can be full-time or part-time depending on funding, staffing and incident response need.  %More about teams? Perhaps not necessary?
An incident response team usually performs intrusion detection, advisory distribution and education and awareness in addition to incident response. \cite{nist800-61}

The structure of the team may vary depending on the organizations resources and needs. The team may be dedicated, virtual or a mix of the two. However, the standard recommends a permanent team. Responsibilities, processes, allocation of roles and an appropriate training program should be prepared. \cite{ISO/IEC27035}

\section{Standards and Guidelines}
\input{iso27035}

\subsection{NorSIS' Guideline for Incident Management}
The \ac{NorSIS} has in cooperation with a group of students\footnote{The students did a survey on incident management in Norwegian \acsp{SME}\cite{sand2010hendelseshaandtering}} developed a guideline for incident management, published in 2010\cite{norsisveiledning}. The aim of this guideline is to give a thorough description of why and how organizations should plan for security incident management, do business impact analysis and explain various measures to improve information security in organizations. The guideline distinguish between minimum requirements and general recommendations. The content in this section is, unless specified otherwise, derived from\cite{norsisveiledning}.

\paragraph{Incident Management Policy} 
An incident management policy should form the basis for developing new incident management plans in organizations. A solid policy should state an organization's objectives for incident management and include a statement ensuring commitment from senior management. Any relevant laws, standards and regulations should also be included. It is essential that the policy has requirements for regularly risk assessment, business impact analysis, tests and training. The guideline also suggests assigning roles and responsibilities as part of the incident management policy.

\paragraph{Business Impact Analysis}
NorSIS suggests that organizations conduct a business impact analysis to identify which services are of significant value and needs to be secured. Conducting risk assessment and identifying possible consequences of security incidents are part of this process. The guideline emphasize the importance of knowing risks and potential threats.  

\paragraph{Preventive Measures}
One of the most cost effective ways to do incident management is implementing preventive measures. Listed as minimum requirements are anti-virus, logs, firewalls, backups, alarms, locks, regularly reviews of threat landscape, and report systems for employees. Other proposed measures include encryption of data and wireless networks.   

\paragraph{Recovery Strategies}
The guideline recommends having a recovery strategy to quickly re-establish business operations after an incident. Suggestions include backup and emergency solutions. Routines and plans should be in place to handle recovery efficiently.

\paragraph{Incident Management Plan}
Organizations should use previous assessments and proposed incident scenarios to develop an incident management plan. It is recommended that individual plans addressing different scenarios are developed. Each incident management plan should state type of incident, what triggered the incident, roles and responsibilities, guidelines for communication and notification, maximum response time, check-list of tasks during incident response and post-incident activities.

\paragraph{Training}
To reduce costs caused by security incidents, NorSIS suggests training employees in correct use of equipment and make sure routines for incident response are well known.

\paragraph{Plan Maintenance}
The guideline recommends that organizations conduct yearly reviews of their incident management plans. To ensure a solid and up-to-date incident management plan, changes should be made based on experience from previous incidents. 

\paragraph{Outsourcing}
When organizations decide to outsource services, they should evaluate and agree on incident management procedures. It is the organization outsourcing that is responsible for securing information properly and to make sure sufficient plans for incident management exist. An agreement should define responsibilities and state expected quality of services. 

\paragraph{Example Threat Scenarios}
There should be no hesitations among employees when responding to typical threat scenarios. Examples of some security incident are given and aims to help organizations decide whether they have a sufficient incident management. Some examples are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Backup is lost due to a fire
\item The organization's network is attacked by a virus
\item There has been a burglary and two servers are stolen 
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
Due to the increased focus on incident management in recent years, a few studies of organizations' practice exist. Unlike our research, most of the previous surveys are based on quantitative questionnaires.

A group of students at HiG\footnote{H\o gskolen i Gj\o vik (Norwegian)} did a survey of incident management policies, implementations, training and routines in Norwegian \acp{SME}. Their results indicate overall insufficient plans for incident management, and poor quality in existing plans. The survey focus on \acp{SME}  in a quantitative questionnaire, whereas our research focus on qualitative analysis of large organizations. Additionally, compliance with standards was not a focus in their studies, as is in ours.

In a quantitative study from 2005\cite{brage}, a survey of Norwegian companies and public institutions were performed to look at routines for security incidents, how theory and practice differ and difference between public and private institutions. Public institutions were found to have greater shortcomings in reporting, training and statistics than private companies.
