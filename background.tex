\section{Incident Management Overview}
%Eller noe i den duren, måtte bare ha en section til subsectionen :p
\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sec:Definitions}
%Eller et annet navn, poenget er å includere definisjoner av disse tidlig i rapporten
In information security incident management there are a few terms that need to be defined clearly. Two such terms are information or computer security incidents\footnote{In this report the terms ``information security incident", ``computer security incident" and ``incident" are used interchangeably.} %NB! På slutten, sjekk at dette faktisk stemmer!
and information or computer security events. It is important to recognize these as two terms of different meaning. The standard \acs{ISO}/\acs{IEC} 27000 \cite{ISO/IEC27000} specifies the following definitions:

\textbf{Information security:} Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information; in addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.

\textbf{Information security event:} Identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of information security policy or failure of safeguards, or a previously unknown situation that may be security relevant.

\textbf{Information security incident:} Single or a series of unwanted or unexpected \emph{information security events} that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.

\textbf{\ac{ISIRT}:} Team of appropriately skilled and trusted members of the organization that handles information security incidents during their lifecycle.

The guidelines \acs{NIST} SP 800-61 \cite{nist800-61} specifies the following definitions:

\textbf{Event:} An event is an observable occurrence in a system or network.

\textbf{Adverse event:} Adverse events are events with a negative consequence, such as system crashes, packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and execution of malware that destroys data.

\textbf{Computer security incident:} A violation or imminent threat of violation\footnote{An ``imminent threat of violation" refers to a situation in which the organization has a factual basis for believing that a specific incident is about to occur.} of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.

\acs{NorCERT} specifies the following definitions \cite{NorCERT3Kvartal2012}:

\textbf{\ac{CSIRT}:} A central tool with the task of protecting important infrastructure. The team must consist of security specialists and they must handle and responds to incidents. Additionally they need to create awareness and educators.

\textbf{\ac{CERT}:} A trademark that can only be used after approval by Carnegie Mellon University. Is in practice the same as a \acs{CSIRT}.

The definition of an adverse event from \cite{nist800-61} is quite similar to the definition of information security event from \cite{ISO/IEC27000}. The definitions of incidents are also quite similar. These definitions are the ones that will be used in this report. \ac{ISIRT}, \ac{CSIRT} and \ac{CERT} define similar types of teams. In this report the term \acs{IRT} is used to denote such a team. 

\subsection{What is Incident Management}
Incident management is a collective term composing all activities associated with managing security incidents. Incident management is not restricted to incident response alone, but includes activities for the entire incident lifecycle; from planning, training and raising awareness to detecting, responding and learning from incidents. 

Various guides and standards describe best practice and suggest activities for effective and efficient incident management. It is important to note that incident response requires a substantial amount of planning and resources. Some of the most important parts of incident response are the existence of guidelines for communication and prioritization of incidents as well as the use of a lessons learned process to gain experience from incidents. \cite{nist800-61}

As part of an incident management capability, organizations should have an incident response policy, an incident response plan and incident response procedures, all of which should be tailored to the specific organization's needs. Additionally it is important to have a planned approach to reporting of vulnerabilities that have not yet been exploited \cite{ISO/IEC27035}.

%The policy should include definitions, forms and commitment from senior management, plans should outline the organization's approach towards incident response, whereas procedures should be based on the current incident management policy and plan.

%\acp{SOP} are a delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists and forms used by the incident response team. An organization should establish procedures regarding communication with various outside parties, like media, law enforcement, other incident response teams, software vendors and \acp{ISP}. It is common to have \acp{PoC} for the various outside parties. \cite{nist800-61}

Incident management is not purely an IT issue since information security incidents threaten an organization as a whole. Having a well-planned and tailored incident management capability is therefore important for organizations in order to protect information. Incident management seeks to both prevent, contain and resolve incidents, in addition to post-learning. ``Incident management is an important tool of overall governance and to have it, in whatever form or shape, is a necessity\cite{enisaGuide}." 

\subsection{\acl{IRT}}
Experience indicate that security incidents occur occasionally, despite extensive preparation and security implementations. Thus, organizations need incident response to mitigate damage caused by incidents. Having an \ac{IRT} will aid organizations in responding to incidents more effectively and efficiently, in addition to providing a structured approach for learning from previous incidents. 

As the various definitions indicate in \ref{sec:Definitions}, an incident response team ``is a team that responds to computer security incidents by providing all necessary services to solve the problem(s) or to support the resolution of them\cite{enisaCSIRTGoodPractices}." The team structure, members, tasks and responsibilities may vary depending on organizations' resources and needs. 

\ac{NIST} recommends having one person in charge of incident response, taking the role as team manager. The team manager should act as a liaison to senior management as well as ensuring that the team has the necessary resources, personnel and skills. It is recommended that team members have diverse backgrounds so they can handle different incidents that may arise. The team manager should assess the situation and assign responsibility for incidents to the most appropriate team member.

Usually teams consist of highly technically skilled persons, and teams should have at least one member with expertise in each major technological category. However, it is not necessarily required that all team members are technical experts. Nevertheless, good problem solving skills and communication skills are essential to the team since effective incidents response require collaboration and coordination within the team and throughout the organization. 

The structure of the team may vary and can be dedicated, virtual or a mix of the two. Number and frequency of incidents as well as team responsibilities should guide organizations' choice of team structure \cite{ISO/IEC27035}. However, whenever justified the ISO/IEC 27035 standard recommends having a permanent team. Some large organizations may even choose to have several incident response teams, e.g. one team per division.

%\acp{IRT} should have clearly defined responsibilities, processes, allocation of roles and appropriate training programs\cite{ISO/IEC27035}. Team members should hold appropriate access permissions and have access to supportive tools to be best prepared to perform incident response \cite{SANShandbook}.
%
It is important for \acp{IRT} to maintain a good relationship to the organization's management. Management ensures proper support and funding for the team, thus building awareness around the added value the team provides as well as including management in training are essential. It is also important for ensuring that team members have the appropriate authority to make decisions whenever necessary in a crisis situation. 

The mission of the \ac{IRT} should reflect what is really important for the organization. The \ac{IRT} must define its constituency. The constituency is the organization or group of organizations and/or people whose incidents the team handles. \cite{enisaGuide}. A satisfied constituency is essential for the existence of \acp{IRT} and it is therefore important that the constituency is included in training to enhance engagement around security and to improve cooperation during incident handling. 

Participating in a community of teams will be beneficial for teams due to collaboration on standards and procedures as well as information and resource sharing. To minimize the frequency of incidents and to mitigate negative impact caused by them, most \acp{IRT} do not \emph{only} provide reactive services, but may also have other responsibilities, such as intrusion detection, advisory distribution, education and raising awareness within the organization\cite{nist800-61}.

\subsection{NorSIS' Guideline for Incident Management}
The \ac{NorSIS} has in cooperation with a group of students\footnote{The students did a survey on incident management in Norwegian \acsp{SME}\cite{sand2010hendelseshaandtering}} developed a guideline for incident management, published in 2010\cite{norsisveiledning}. The aim of this guideline is to give a thorough description of why and how organizations should plan for security incident management, do business impact analysis and explain various measures to improve information security in organizations. The guideline distinguish between minimum requirements and general recommendations. The content in this section is, unless specified otherwise, derived from\cite{norsisveiledning}.

\paragraph{Incident Management Policy} 
An incident management policy should form the basis for developing new incident management plans in organizations. A solid policy should state an organization's objectives for incident management and include a statement ensuring commitment from senior management. Any relevant laws, standards and regulations should also be included. It is essential that the policy has requirements for performing regularly risk assessment, business impact analysis, tests and training. The guideline also suggests assigning roles and responsibilities as part of the incident management policy.

\paragraph{Business Impact Analysis}
NorSIS suggests that organizations conduct a business impact analysis to identify which services are of significant value and needs to be secured. Conducting risk assessment and identifying possible consequences of security incidents are part of this process. The guideline emphasize the importance of knowing risks and potential threats.  

\paragraph{Preventive Measures}
One of the most cost effective ways to do incident management is implementing preventive measures. Listed as minimum requirements are anti-virus, logs, firewalls, backups, alarms, locks, regularly reviews of threat landscape, and report systems for employees. Other proposed measures include encryption of data and wireless networks.   

\paragraph{Recovery Strategies}
The guideline recommends having a recovery strategy to quickly re-establish business operations after an incident. Suggestions include backup and emergency solutions. Routines and plans should be in place to handle recovery efficiently.

\paragraph{Incident Management Plan}
Organizations should use previous assessments and proposed incident scenarios to develop an incident management plan. It is recommended that individual plans addressing different scenarios are developed. Each incident management plan should state type of incident, what triggered the incident, roles and responsibilities, guidelines for communication and notification, maximum response time, check-list of tasks during incident response and post-incident activities.

\paragraph{Training}
To reduce costs caused by security incidents, NorSIS suggests training employees in correct use of equipment and make sure routines for incident response are well known.

\paragraph{Plan Maintenance}
The guideline recommends that organizations conduct yearly reviews of their incident management plans. To ensure a solid and up-to-date incident management plan, changes should be made based on experience from previous incidents. 

\paragraph{Outsourcing}
When organizations decide to outsource services, they should evaluate and agree on incident management procedures. It is the organization outsourcing that is responsible for securing information properly and to make sure sufficient plans for incident management exist. An agreement should define responsibilities and state expected quality of services. 

\paragraph{Example Threat Scenarios}
There should be no hesitations among employees when responding to typical threat scenarios. Examples of some security incidents are given and they aim to help organizations decide whether they have a sufficient incident management. Some examples are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Backup is lost due to a fire
\item The organization's network is attacked by a virus
\item There has been a burglary and two servers are stolen 
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
In recent years the amount of available academic literature addressing incident management has increased along with overall interest for the topic. However, despite the amount of available literature there is limited knowledge about how organizations apply incident management in practice and thus an interesting topic for research. As a starting point we looked at related research papers and surveys and we discuss some of them briefly in this section.

Eugene H. Spafford \cite{spafford2003failure} wrote a paper in 2003 where he presented the first large internet worm and discussed what happened during the years after this large incident, which occurred in 1988. The worm led to the CERT at Carnegie-Mellon University being established. The three flaws that this worm exploited were trust relationships, buffer overflows and poor default configuration. The author claims that these flaws have not been removed but rather worsened. The author also questions the CERT model. He claims that incident response is uncoordinated and of minimal effectiveness. Lastly he expects that he can in 2013 or 2018 write a paper about 2003 as the time were we did not know how bad it was going to get. This work is quite different from our thesis, but it is interesting that he points to lack of lessons learned and predicts that the situation in the time of this writing is going to be bad.

In 2005 Jamie Riden \cite{riden2005responding} wrote a paper based on a case study conducted over two years where he studied security incident response in a large academic network. The study is mainly a description of responses to specific incidents. It does not focus on plans and procedures, which is an important part of our study. Riden focuses on why the incidents happened and what could have been done to prevent them while recognizing that not all incidents can be prevented.

In a study from 2005\cite{brage}, a survey of Norwegian companies and public institutions was conducted looking at routines for information security incidents, how theory and practice differed as well as potential differences between organizations in public and private sectors. The survey showed that statistical material about incidents were inaccurate due to lack of implemented routines, lack of training and weak definitions of security incidents in general. Public institutions were found to have greater shortcomings in reporting, training and statistics than private ones. A lack of documentation and use of metrics when outsourcing IT-systems were also revealed. Of all the participating organizations only half followed international standards for information security. Further, the study disclosed a gap between incident management theory and practice in terms of how organizations handle information security incidents. Even though private organizations were found to have overall better incident management, there were still room for improvements, especially regarding reporting, training and statistics. Keeping track of how previous incidents were handled can be an important part of a learning and improvement process and we therefore wish to look at to what extent previous incidents have been handled in accordance with plans and how they were used to improve current procedures.

In 2007 Werlinger et al. \cite{werlinger2007detecting} conducted an exploratory study using interviews and questionnaires to reveal what tasks security practitioners performs during security incidents, what skills and tools are necessary and what strategies are required in order to deal with security incidents. They grouped tasks into the main stages detection, analysis and response. They identified pattern recognition, hypothesis generation and cooperation as needed skills. Two identified strategies in incident response were isolation and simulation. The study is somewhat similar to our study, but it lacks detailed information and analysis.

Werlinger et al. \cite{werlinger2010preparation} conducted in 2009 16 semi-structured interviews with IT security practitioners from seven organizational types. Their research focused on diagnostic work performed in response to security incidents as well as the tools used in this process. Their findings show that a great deal of tacit knowledge is used in the diagnostic work. In addition to relying on tools the employees used their own technical knowledge as well as their knowledge of the organization and its systems. The findings also showed that intensive diagnostic work was needed to be able to respond to security incidents. This research differentiate from our research in the sense that they focus mainly on diagnosis and the tools used for that and not the entire process of incident management. Additionally there is no comparison with existing standards and guidelines in the analysis of the data.

In 2010, a group of students at HiG\footnote{H\o gskolen i Gj\o vik (Norwegian)} did a survey of incident management policies, implementations, training and routines in Norwegian \acp{SME}\cite{sand2010hendelseshaandtering}. They performed interviews and questionnaires and concluded that there was still room for improvement regarding incident management in Norwegian \acp{SME}. Also, having a chief of information security was shown to be beneficial as those organizations tended to have better plans for incident management in addition to using their plans more often. Additionally, how well organizations perform incident management was shown to differ between public and private sector. Their research indicate overall insufficient plans for incident management among Norwegian \acp{SME}, and poor quality in existing plans. One of our research objectives is thus identifying what plans and procedures are established in organizations. Finally, the students proposed in cooperation with the Norwegian Centre for Information Security (NorSIS) a guide for incident management customized for \acp{SME}. Since then, both new standards and guidelines have been published addressing incident management. It is thus interesting to look at how organizations perform incident management and how these standards and guidelines are adopted in current plans and procedures for incident management.

Incident response teams are of utmost importance to incident management. We therefore found research related to \acp{IRT}' tasks, structure and responsibilities interesting. As described in section \ref{section:standardsandguidelines}, several guides address establishment and running of \acp{IRT} and a few studies also look at how \acp{IRT} operate in practice. In 2003, Killcrece et al. \cite{killcrece2003state} looked at current state of practice for \acp{IRT} and found several shortcomings for teams in general such as lack of tools, training and experienced personnel. However, during the past decade new standards and guidelines have emerged and the field of incident management has matured significantly.  Based on this and several other studies, Ahmad et al. \cite{ahmad2012incident} presents a case study exploring issues faced by incident response teams that affect the greater organizational security function. They found organizations lacked the ability to exploit their organizational learning capability. A lack of proper information dissemination and organizations tending to focus on technical learning over policy and risk were also discussed. Further, Wiik et al. \cite{gonzalezlimits} presents a simulation model to better understand the main factors influencing an \ac{IRT}'s effectiveness. They identified that ``short-term pressure from a growing incident work load prevents attempts for developing more response capability long-term". 

While studying related work we came to understand that threat landscape, standards and best practise guidelines change rapidly. Surveys conducted only few years apart reveal that information security and incident management are maturing. Thus, we find looking at how organizations perform incident management in practice highly relevant.
