\chapter{Findings}
\label{chp:findings}
This chapter presents findings from the document studies and interviews. The findings from each case are described separately. It should be noted that in this chapter, information has not been analysed or interpreted by the authors, but only introduced as given in the interviews or found in the documents. The \textit{grouping} of the information however, is based on the standards and guidelines presented in section \ref{section:standardsandguidelines} and represents the first step of the qualitative data analysis approach, as presented in section \ref{sec:qualitativeAnalysis}.
