\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:introduction}
The occurrence of computer security incidents have been a known issue ever since the introduction of the PC. However, in recent years there has been an increased focus on information security incidents. Several major incidents have received attention in the media and drawn attention to the topic. %A few studies exist, new standards such as ISO/IEC 27035 have emerged and several guidelines have been developed.

It is interesting to study how organizations perform incident management in practice. How organizations prepare for and handle information security incidents, comply with standards and learn from mistakes are of interest. We want to assess how various factors contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of organizations' incident management. By identifying how these factors affect successful incident management, we hope to find improvements to incident management practice for relevant organizations.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
We aimed to draw attention to and increase awareness around incident management. By investigating how various organizations perform incident management, what plans and procedures are developed and to what extent these plans and procedures comply with standards, we also hoped to find potential improvements.

The main research question of this thesis is:
\begin{itemize}
\item How do organizations perform information security incident management in practice?
\end{itemize}

This research question is further divided into the following sub-questions:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep-0.1cm
\item What plans and procedures for information security incident management are established in organizations?
\item To what extent are existing standards/guidelines adopted in plans for information security incident management?
\item To what extent have previous information security incidents been handled in accordance with predetermined plans? 
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
We have collected information about three large Norwegian organizations' incident management processes by conducting qualitative interviews, document studies and a survey. We did not include any small or medium sized organizations, as we wanted to study large organizations since they are particularly exposed to targeted attacks and espionage. As we only included three organizations in our study, generalization was not possible. The reason for not including more organizations in our research was the time restrictions for this thesis.

\section{Outline}
Chapter \ref{chp:method} discusses the research method used for this study.
Chapter \ref{chp:background} presents a background on information security incident management. It explains what incident management is and provides a review of relevant standards and guidelines. In chapter \ref{chp:CaseIntroductions} the three organizations in the case study are presented. The findings from the case study are presented in chapter \ref{chp:findings}. Chapter \ref{chp:discussion} discusses the findings presented in chapter \ref{chp:findings} and compares these with the literature presented in chapter \ref{chp:background}. Chapter \ref{chp:conclusion} provides a conclusion of the findings as well as suggestions for future work. In Appendix A the information sheet given to the participating organizations can be found. Appendix B contains the interview guide used as a basis for the collection of empirical data in this study. In Appendix C, the employee survey is included. All of the appendices are written in Norwegian.
