\chapter*{Abstract}
Despite the implementation of security, information security incidents occur. Preventive measures is therefore not sufficient and establishing an incident management capability is essential. In this thesis organizations' incident management practices are studied. An empirical study was conducted, including qualitative interviews and document studies of three large Norwegian organizations. The findings show that they to a large extent comply with standards and guidelines, but that there is still room for improvements.
