\section{Qualitative research}
\label{sec:qualitativeresearch}
We used a qualitative research method where we focused on relatively few informants. Unlike a quantitative approach where using questionnaires to gather information from a large number of participants is common, we wanted in-depth information from selected organizations. Using a qualitative research method enabled us to do rich and detailed analysis. 

Further, we followed an inductive research approach. In inductive research, researchers perform field studies followed by deriving theories from observations. This method is a contrast to deductive research where a theory is developed initially, followed by observations to evaluate it\cite{oates2005researching}. 

Deductive and inductive research methods are defined as follows\cite{bhattacherjee2012social}: 

\textbf{Deductive research:} The objective is to test a theory or hypothesis using new empirical data. This approach is known as \emph{theory-testing} research.

\textbf{Inductive research:} The objective is to infer theories and patterns from observed data. Also called \emph{theory-building} research.

Three main objectives for inductive research are to compress the extensive amount of qualitative data gathered into a summary, to establish links between research objectives and elements from the findings and to develop theories or models about the underlying structure of experience which are found in the data\cite{thomas2006general}. 

\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:caseStudy}
\input{caseStudy}

\subsection{Background Study}
\label{sec:background}
The first step in our research were a background study of security incident management. In order to find appropriate questions for the interviews we found it necessary to study relevant literature such as standards and best practice guidelines. We focused on the well-established and internationally accepted ISO/IEC standards and documentation from the \ac{NIST} as well as various other guides.

We also looked at related work and what has been studied earlier in the field of incident management. In this way the background study was used to guide the data collection. It was also used in the data analysis, by comparing standards and prior developed theory to the findings of this study. This is consistent with the definition of a case study, as presented at the beginning of section \ref{sec:caseStudy}.

\subsection{Qualitative Interviews}
\label{sec:interviews}
We chose to perform qualitative interviews in our research as they are well-known and powerful tools for information gathering in qualitative research\cite{myers2007qualitative}. The main objective of qualitative interviews is to see the research topic from interviewee's perspective and understand why and how they got that particular perspective\cite{cassell2004essential}. To meet this objective, qualitative interviews are driven by open questions, a low degree of structure and often focus on specific situations and experiences made by the interviewee. 

We used what is referred to in literature as semi-structured interviews\cite{cassell2004essential}. We wanted interviewees to talk freely about their experiences, and thus we did not follow a strict order of predefined questions. However, to ensure we got all necessary information we used an interview guide. The interview guide worked as an incomplete script and states the main goals for our research as well as the main research questions and topics for the interview.

Questions were not asked in any pre-defined order during interviews. This enabled us to ask follow-up questions and ask for elaborations on certain topics. When using semi-structured interviews, interviewees can be seen as being ``participants" in the research, rather than objects only answering pre-defined questions.

Interviews were performed face-to-face and voice recorded. We believe that conducting interviews face-to-face helped build trust with interviewees and thus gave better and more elaborative answers. It also gave us opportunity to explain and elaborate questions that were unclear. Since we recorded all of the interviews we could focus on listening and thus ask valuable follow-up questions instead of being distracted by writing down answers. Additionally, we could listen to the recordings several times as needed and clarify things that were unclear later.

%Developing an interview guide, carrying out interviews and analysing them can be highly time-consuming activities. Participating in interviews is also time-consuming for interviewees, which could have made it challenging to recruit interviewees for our study. One mitigation to the risk of not recruiting interviewees was sending out letters explaining the main purpose of our research, what was expected by the interviewee, and how the interviews would play out. We also notified organizations at an early stage and set dates for the interviews to ensure their commitment.

%Qualitative interviews are very flexible as they can be used to tackle various forms of research questions related to organizations. Despite the time effort spent on developing an interview guide, questions and conducting interviews, we found qualitative interviews to add great value to our research.

\subsection{Document Study}
\label{sec:documentStudy}
In case studies, documents are often used to verify or to question data obtained from other data collecting methods. To complement information gathered from interviews we studied relevant academic literature, standards and organization-specific documents such as policies and plans. This enabled us to compare standards, plans and current practice of incident management in organizations.

When using documents in research one should be aware of possible bias and other elements that could compromise reliability\cite{oates2005researching}. In our case study we looked at both public and confidential documents.  We believe that by signing confidentiality agreements we were presented with authentic documents from participating organizations. Nevertheless, we kept in mind that information could be outdated, not applicable or incorrect.      

%\section{Action Research}

\subsection{Qualitative Data Analysis}
\label{sec:qualitativeAnalysis}
As mentioned in \ref{sec:qualitativeresearch} we have chosen a qualitative and inductive research approach. For the data analysis we used the ``general inductive approach for analysing qualitative evaluation data", as described in \cite{thomas2006general}. David R. Thomas presents a ``systematic set of procedures for analysing qualitative data" and a ``straightforward approach for deriving findings in the context of focused evaluation questions". We used a set of predefined research questions to guide our work and found this approach less complicated and more suitable than other approaches to qualitative data analysis.

``The inductive approach is a systematic procedure for analysing qualitative data in which the analysis is likely to be guided by specific evaluation objectives."

``Inductive analysis refers to approaches that primarily use detailed readings of raw data to derive concepts, themes, or a model through interpretations made from the raw data by an evaluator or researcher"

``The primary purpose of the inductive approach is to allow research findings to emerge from the frequent, dominant, or significant themes inherent in raw data, without the restraints imposed by structured methodologies."

Three main objectives for inductive research are to compress the extensive amount of qualitative data gathered into a summary, to establish links between research objectives and elements from the findings and to develop theories or models about the underlying structure of experience which are found in the data\cite{thomas2006general}. 

``The inductive approach described in this article is intended to clarify the data reduction process by describing a set of procedures for creating meaning in complex data through the development of summary themes or categories from the raw data"

``Although specific objectives or evaluation questions undoubtedly constrain the range of possible interpretations and outcomes from an inductive analysis by focusing attention on specific aspects of the data, the approach is unlike deductive investigations in which a specific hypothesis, theory, or model is being tested."

``The outcome of an inductive analysis is the development of categories into a model or framework that summarizes the raw data and conveys key themes and processes."

Unlike grounded theory, ``, researchers using the general inductive approach typically limit their theory building to the presentation and description of the most important categories."

``The intended outcome of the process (the process of inductive coding) is to create a small number of summary categories (e.g., between three and eight categories) that in the evaluator’s view capture the key aspects of the themes identified in the raw data and are assessed to be the most important themes given the evaluation objectives."

\paragraph{Typical workflow}
``The general inductive approach was used to analyze the qualitative data to identify themes in the text data that were related to the evaluation objectives."

1. Close reading of the text\\
2. Develop specific themes, which in the view of the investigators capture core\\ messages reported by participants. (her vi bruker de kategoriene fra ISO?)
3. Group themes into broader categories. Create labels and summary descriptions of the categories.\\
4. Themes constitute the primary framework for the findings.


\paragraph{Assessing trustworthiness(credibility)} To assess the trustworthiness of our findings we let participants comment on the interpretations made in our report. By providing a summery of the interviews, participants could challenge our interpretations and comment on whether our findings were related to their personal experience.

\paragraph{Presenting the findings}
``When reporting findings from inductive analysis, the summary or top-level categories are often used as main headings in the findings, with specific categories as subheadings. It is good practice to include detailed descriptions of categories and suitable quotations from the text to illustrate the meanings of the categories."

``The sequence used by Williams and Irurita (1998) to describe key information about the category is an effective style for reporting qualitative findings. It consists of:

• a label for the category,\\
• the authors’ description of the meaning of the category, and\\
• a quotation from the raw text to elaborate the meaning of the category and to show the type of text coded into the category."\\

``This style is recommended for reporting the most important categories that constitute the main findings of an inductive analysis."

Advantages:
Gives a rich and detailed analysis
Could be more than one ``correct" solution or theory based on various objects of analysis.
Important to evaluate ones sources.

Disadvantages:
The interpretation of data is based on researchers background.
The amount of data can be challenging.

\section{Participants}
%In the nature of qualitative research participants were chosen to be diverse such that different perspectives on incident management (in the same context) could be studied.large organizations that are likely to have experiences severe security incidents. + de i Gjovik gjorde paa small/medium.. her gjor vi en dybdestudie av noe annet!Hvorfor de vi valgte? Hvorfor er de interessante? 

\section{Ethical Considerations}
\label{sec:ethical}
%Litt i forhold til at man behandler sensitiv information og saann
The main ethical concern related to our research is the potentially confidential information revealed during interviews. It is unlikely that organizations want details about their information security practices to be publicly known. Another important aspect was that we performed interviews and the privacy of the participants had to be considered. Since a voice recorder was used during interviews, participants could potentially be identified later by voice recognition. To make sure that the participants knew exactly what they participated in, they were given information about how collected data was handled through a statement of consent. They were also given the right to withdraw from the study at any given time. This project was reported to the Norwegian Social Science Data services. The information sheet, including the statement of consent can be found in Appendix A (in Norwegian). Before submitting the report, the participants were given the opportunity to read through the material and correct any potential misunderstandings.   

As we got insight into confidential documents, we had to sign confidentiality statements beforehand.


\subsection{Anonymization}
No individuals or individual organizations are recognizable in this report. Participating organizations are given pseudonyms. All relations between individuals and individual organizations and results are anonymized at the end of the study, and only available to the students and partly their supervisors during the study. The term anonymization means that any information that could directly identify individuals or individual organizations is deleted and that any information that indirectly could identify individuals or individual organizations is deleted or changed. At the end of the study all recordings are deleted.

\section{Challenges}
This case study relies on qualitative information and a challenge related to that is to work hard to report all evidence fairly. Additionally this type of research provides little basis for scientific generalization. \cite{CaseStudyResearch}

For quantitative data there exist clear convention for analysis, but there are fewer guidelines for the analysis of quantitative data. In relation to this Allen S. Lee states in \cite{lee1989scientific}, ``but the analyst faced with a bank of qualitative data has very few guidelines for protection against self delusion".

Basing most of our information gathering on interviews, the challenges with this approach had to be carefully considered. The authors had little or no experience in preparing and conducting qualitative interviews. Michael D. Myers and Michael Newman discusses potential challenges with using qualitative interviews in\cite{myers2007qualitative}. 

They mention the artificiality of qualitative interviews where one interrogates a stranger that does not know or trust you. The lack of trust may cause the interviewee to withhold information that could be of value to the study. As an attempt to mitigate trust issues the procedure of handling data (anonymization) was presented as well as highlighting that the project had been reported to the Norwegian Social Science Data Services.   

Problems could also arise if too little time is assigned for the interviews. Questions could be rushed causing inaccurate information or that important information are left out. To avoid time limitations being a concern, we assigned more time than estimated for each interview. We also used the interview guide with predefined questions and topics as well as correcting any misunderstandings during the interview to avoid ambiguous questions.

When relying on qualitative interviews for information, one have to consider potential interviewee bias as for instance security incident management knowledge vary greatly among employees in an organization. In addition, Myers and Newman mentions the possibility for interviewees to construct knowledge to appear knowledgeable and rational. By giving interviewees enough time to answer questions and carry out interviews as a dialogue, we hope to have avoided these problem.

One challenge of using qualitative data is that interpretation of information is somewhat based on researchers' background. Being students with similar backgrounds and limited experience we believe that choosing an inductive qualitative research approach gave less bias in our results since we did not aim at proving a specific theory, but rather aimed at starting our information gathering with open minds.
