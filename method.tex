\section{Choice of Method}

Our research question, including the sub-questions are about explaining how something, i.e. incident management in organizations, works in depth. This is an indication that case study is a suitable method \cite{kitchenham1995case}. %superdårlig skrevet, måtte bare rable ned noe

For the interviews in our study we chose a qualitative approach. This allowed us to focus on fewer and more in-depth interviews than with a quantitative approach, but eliminated the possibility to generalize the results. We chose to do semi-structured interviews conducted face-to-face.
