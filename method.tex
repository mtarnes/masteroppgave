\section{Choice of Methodology}

For the interviews in our study we chose a qualitative approach. This allowed us to focus on fewer and more in-depth interviews than with a quantitative approach, but eliminated the possibility to generalize the results. We chose to do semi-structured interviews conducted face-to-face.
