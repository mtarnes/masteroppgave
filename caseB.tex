\subsection{Preparation}
The organization distinguish between security breaches and incidents. Security breaches are events that violate the organization's security principles caused intentionally by employees. Examples include employees visiting illegal websites or sharing their password with others. Incidents on the other hand are events threatening information security, but not necessarily caused by disloyal employees. Security breaches and incidents are often seen as deviations to the normal situation and that require some sort of structural change. The organization has a deviation system that keep track of all kinds of deviations, whether it is physical shortcomings or things related to information security.

When asked about what they consider to be the worst security incident the organization could possibly experience they answer that their biggest fear is disloyal employees leaking information to outsiders without being discovered. Other causes for compromised or disclosed information would also be considered very serious, but most likely these incidents are easier to detect. Information is the most important asset to protect, most other things can be restored or repaired.

Another severe consequence of incidents are service interruption. Ensuring that services are available and that business continuity is maintained are considered high priority. If services are unavailable, employees are left idle which potentially implies a major financial loss. Availability and access to files are therefore extremely important. Redundancy of equipment and other mechanisms are implemented to ensure availability. Investments to ensure availability are justified by the severe financial costs of service unavailability.

In addition to financial losses the organization sees reputation damage as a serious consequence of incidents.
