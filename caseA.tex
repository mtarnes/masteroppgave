This section describes the results from interviews and document study for Case A. 

\subsection{Preparation}
The IT security manager defines an incident %Skal endre dette til information security? Han nevnte at det ikke trengte å være IT-relatert engang, så kanskje ok å bare skrive incident?
as the occurrence of something unwanted. This can be something that belongs to a predefined category of unwanted incidents or an incident of a nature that you see is unwanted when it occurs. More specifically an \ac{ICT} incident will usually involve loss of information or loss of control over information systems. This is a definition that is known in the organization. The categories of unwanted incidents are determined through risk assessments. This is included in their information security policy which is approved by the management and distributed to all parts of the organization. The policy refers to a document containing principles for information security. Some of these principles addresses risk management. They have another document that further specifies their risk assessment process. %Se prinsipper for informasjonssikkerhet del 1, referer videre til rutiner for risiko og sårbarhetsanalyse

The IT security manager states loss of information related to the organization's core activities as being the worst information security incident they can experience. This could damage their relationship to partners, their general reputation and their credibility. Additionally it may damage the work and career of individuals with ownership of the information. %Gir dette bort for mye info? skjnner man kanskje at det er snakk om forskning?
Another aspect is that they own information that should not fall into the wrong hands. This can be information that goes under the \ac{UN} treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT) \cite{NPT}, which includes information that may be used for spreading of nuclear weapons and weapons technology. %Er dette ok å skrive??
The loss of such information could obviously have severe consequences.

The organization generates a report once a year, that contains the incidents they have experienced. This way they have an overview over previous incidents.

The organization has, as mentioned, an information security policy and principles for information security document. The latter is to be updated if there are changes in the threat landscape or at least every other year. It is currently a subject for audit. It is up to the departments to make sure that employees and other users are aware of these documents. The IT security manager does not expect that all of the users have detailed knowledge of these documents, even though it is stated that all users have to comply with them. The IT department uses these documents actively. %NB spør om dette i ansatteinetrvju!!!
During the last years the level of threat has increased for this organization and as a consequence they are going to perform a risk and vulnerability assessment for all the departments in the organization. In addition to the mentioned documents, they have an internal policy for incident handling.

They have several systems that are critical for their operations. This means that they need backup solutions for these systems in case of incidents. The IT security manager thinks that they have very good continuity plans. They have among other things tried to remove any single point of failure.

They have a contingency plan for the IT department, that describes a set of incidents. It does not directly target information security incidents, but it includes scenarios where systems are unavailable. A system is unavailable if they have lost control over either if someone has taken control over the system or if there has been unauthorized access. The loss of admin passwords is an example of such an incident. When there is an incident so serious that the contingency plan must be initiated the management is also involved. The contingency plan includes communication routines related to incidents. 

They have an information department that is responsible for all external communication and they cooperate closely with the IT department. The organization has a procedure for contact with the police in case of any violation of law. If the organization wishes to report a crime it is the manager that has to do this, although the IT security manager will provide the police with any relevant information he has access to. The manager is the only one that can report crimes on behalf of the organization, as this is a government owed organization.

They do not have a holistic plan for incident handling because no incidents are the same. Related to that he stated:

\begin{quote}
\textit{"To have a detailed guideline that takes all possibilities into account and that you have to change each time you get a new system %. I think that would be 
[...] we are not that good [...] and I don't think we have ambitions to be that good either"}
\end{quote}

They do however have general guidelines for handling of security incidents. Certain types of incidents are repeating though, like phishing, and they have more detailed guidelines for these types of incidents.

\paragraph{\acl{IRT}}
Because the organization has an internet domain they are required to have an abuse email-address and they have a team that is responsible for receiving and handling cases reported to this address. The members of this abuse team are a part of the IT-support function of the organization and are part-time employees. Cases that involve employees, botnets or spam are handled by full-time employees at the service desk. One of these employees is the leader of the team. The IT security manager is also part of this team in a supervising role. The team consists of seven people. The cases sent to abuse are not just received on an email address, but go straight into a case management system. 

The usual notifications will be received during work-hours, but they also have someone available 24/7 if something extra serious occurs. In that case they need to be alerted specifically, and it will typically be a system owner who will notify the person on duty.

They have a tool for mapping IP-addresses to users at specific times, that they need to use related to incidents. There is one person in the team that is responsible for this tool. They also have someone responsible for administrative tasks such as shifts. There is additionally someone who is responsible for documentation, especially in cases they have not seen before.

The team performs a limited amount of preventive work. They see repeating incidents and have reviews of larger incidents and use this to identify changes that are needed. They use the \ac{ITIL} framework, discussed in section \ref{section:ITIL} of this report, and treat repeating incidents as problems.

They often need to communicate with the various sections of the organization when incidents occur. The people working there are not specialized in handling security incidents, but they know how the systems work, and are therefore important resources. There is a daily designated contact person for one of the sections. Last year they experienced a targeted phishing attack and this led them to gather a team consisting of resources from various sections.

Most of their employees involved in incident handling have an IT background and thereby a solid technological knowledge. Additionally they go through a training process when they are hired. There is also a thorough interview process. During their time in the job they often get new tasks and need training for this. 

\paragraph{Standards and Guidelines}

\paragraph{Awareness and Training}
The organization conducted an information campaign with an external supplier about a year and a half ago. The supplier delivered slides containing small lectures that were sent via email. These were lectures about themes such as how to protect your password. In relation to their attitude towards awareness, he stated: 

\begin{quote}
\textit{"There is a principle that says, never waste a good crisis"}
\end{quote}

This means that they use incidents, typically that others have experienced and communicate these to the organization. He mentioned that personally he takes any opportunity to talk about the importance of protecting information.

About a year ago they conducted a contingency rehearsal with information security as the chosen theme. The management was involved in this training. It included seven levels of escalation. The training contributed to increased information security awareness in the management as well as being a test of their central contingency plan.

\subsection{Detection and Analysis}
Incident handlers are required to give the reporter an answer so that he knows that the potential incident is being looked into and that his report is appreciated.

\paragraph{Initial Detection}
%Ta med rapporteringsrutiner og ansattes kjennskap til disse her??
Their internet supplier notifies them if they see that there are any compromised hosts in their network. They can also assist in the incident handling upon request.

\paragraph{Categorization}
In addition to categorizing incidents based on type (spam, phishing etc.) they categorize based on what service or system they belong to.

They also categorize incidents based on impact. The use the categories low, medium and high. Medium is when service is unavailable for several persons and high is when service is unavailable for the whole organization.

\subsection{Incident Response}
They have a tool that can be used to monitor connections to their network. An example he provided was that he discovered that several users logged in on the same foreign IP-address. He then contacted them and found that they were in fact abroad, and that their user accounts had not been compromised. By contacting them first the users avoided a cumbersome process of being blocked and having to regain access. They also have tools that they use to analyse emails in spam cases. They have the possibility to log in to the email server as admin and fetch emails sent to people. This is only done in serious cases, and if it is done, they only look at emails relevant to the case in order to maintain privacy. The IT security manager has only done this once, and this was in case of a targeted phishing attack. This attack happened in two stages where the first stage was targeted to the organization and was used to retrieve usernames and passwords from users. The compromised user accounts where subsequently used to send new bank-phishing emails.

\paragraph{Workflow}
The organization has specified workflows for specific types of incidents. They do not have a general workflow that applies for all incidents. Figure \ref{fig:WorkflowCaseABotnet} illustrates the workflow for a botnet incident. The figure is derived from a description given at the interview. 

\begin{itemize}\itemsep-0.2cm
\item The process is initiated by a report received in their abuse system or from some other source. 
\item The incident is categorized based on type (botnet, virus etc.)
\item If there is more than one affected host, the case will be split into one case per host and the following steps will be taken for each case.
\item If the incident is particularly serious the host will be blocked and the user in question will subsequently be contacted.
\item If the incident is not so serious the user in question will be contacted and subsequently blocked.
\item If contact is not established the user will be blocked and then tried contacted again.
\item The affected host is cleaned up.
\item The user will regain access.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Escalation}

\paragraph{Electronic Evidence}
They have good cooperation with the police and in cases that may lead to criminal cases they do not try to investigate themselves, so that they will not destroy any evidence. %Ca rundt 50 min ut i intervjuet
