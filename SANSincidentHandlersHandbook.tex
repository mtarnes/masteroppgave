\subsection{SANS: Incident Handler's Handbook}
This section gives an introduction to SANS' Incident Handler's Handbook and the content is, unless specified otherwise, derived from \cite{SANShandbook}. The purpose of this document is to provide sufficient information for IT professionals and managers to create incident response policies, standards and teams for their organization. Six phases of incident management are described and recommended to be followed in sequence as each phase builds on the previous one. 

\paragraph{Preparation} 
This is the most crucial phase as it determines how well the incident response team will be able to respond to security incidents. During this phase, several key elements should be implemented to avoid potential problems while responding to security incidents.

Organizations should develop a policy stating the organization's principles, rules and practices. After the establishment of a security policy, organizations should develop a response plan with a prioritization of incidents based on organizational impact. Having this prioritization scheme could aid in obtaining necessary resources for incident management by ensuring commitment from senior management as they will better understand risk and business impact. It is also recommended to have a communication plan so the response process is not delayed by uncertainty of whom to contact in unexpected situations. These plans should also state when it is appropriate to contact law enforcement.

Documenting incidents is beneficial for organizations. A thorough documentation is useful for lessons learned and might also serve as evidence if an incident is considered a criminal act. The establishment of a \ac{CIRT} is part of the preparation phase. It is vital that also their activities are documented properly. 

\paragraph{Identification} 
The first step of this phase is identification of security events by detecting deviations from ``normal" operations within the organization. This is followed by a decision of whether the event is categorized as an incident. Organizations should implement various tools to gather documentation about events, such that incidents and patterns can be identified. Examples of such tools include \acp{IDS}, firewalls and log files. Typically, incidents are reported to the \ac{CIRT} that decides the scope of the incidents and how to move forward.

\paragraph{Containment} 
In this phase organizations try to limit the damage and prevent further damage caused by security incidents. It is recommended to isolate compromised systems to avoid escalation. An easy measure could be to disconnect affected parts of the system. 

Several steps are necessary for a successful incident response. The first step is called short-term containment and is concerned with limiting the damage by implementing short-term but effective measures. The second step is concerned with ensuring proper back-up of information before system resources can be restored. The final step is called long-term containment and involves removing alternations made by an attacker, installing security patches and limiting further escalation of the incident.

\paragraph{Eradication} 
Affected assets and systems are restored during this phase. To avoid similar incidents in the future, defences should be improved. Continuous documentation is important in this phase to ensure that proper steps were taken in previous phases in addition to determine the overall impact on the organization. It is recommended that all affected systems are scanned with anti-malware software to ensure that all potential latent malware is removed. 

\paragraph{Recovery} 
Activities in this phase include bringing affected systems back into operation and preventing future incidents caused by the same problem as previous incidents. Other activities are testing, monitoring and validating systems to ensure they are not reinfected. 

\paragraph{Lessons Learned} 
The final phase's main objectives are to learn from incidents to improve the CIRT's performance and to provide material to aid in future incident responses. An important activity is to hold a post-incident meeting that summarizes the incident management process. This phase evaluates an organization's incident management procedures and identifies areas of improvement.
